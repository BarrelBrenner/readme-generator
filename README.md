Here is a readme generator application

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example I used fs & inquirer, so to install those I would type the following -- "npm i fs", then "npm i inquirer".

Once that's finished you can begin running the application. For my example I typed -- "node index.js" -- which is what i named the file.

Then, it will give you a list of prompts to answer as you wish, followed by the last question being a checkbox type to see what license you would like to use if any.

A walk-through video of application is linked here -- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zQbR75F_XBwN733KGSzEifsxQg8kSKfe/view

Thank you for your time & take care
